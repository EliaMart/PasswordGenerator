# PasswordGenerator

In this homework assignment I was given a starter code and used it to create an application to enable individuals to generate random passwords based on criteria the individual selected. 

To create a secure password, the user clicks generate password. A series of promopts will pop out asking the user to choose: choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters, confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. If the prompts are answered with incorrect values an alert will pop up saying a valid response is needed. Once all prompts are answered correctly, a random password will be generated.
